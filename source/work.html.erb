    <h2> Logos. </h2>
    <p>
    I still remember during my freshman year of high school job shadowing the great Portland graphic designer Steve Smith.
    My path would change directions several time but ultimately I was brought back to an early passion of mine.
    Everywhere I go, I notice signs, typography, and graffiti that shapes our cities.   We live in a designed world, so when creating a logo,
    I like to think of how a design will look on a hat, a t-shirt, a window, a billboard, or a website.  I aim to capture the essence of a brand and
    company as well as create a timeless logo.

    Iâ€™m capable of using Sketch or Photoshop to create pixel perfect wireframes.  However, with Balsamiq,
    I can create a quick low fidelity mockup that can focus the discussion on UX and UI challenges without getting
    hung up on colors and the little details.  These wireframes can quickly be turned into pixel perfect html and CSS
    prototypes and the project can begin to come to life and take shape.

    <h2> Development. </h2>
    <p>
    My experience in development began with a Middleman blog for an idea I had called <a href= "https://eastwind-search.herokuapp.com"><nobr>Eastwind-Search</nobr></a>.    
    I then created a site using Middleman for my business Sattwa Chai. It was a three page site, where customers
    could learn about our history, contact us, as well as a purchase our products through chai-direct.com.
    We have since sold the company, but my code can be reviewed at <a href= "https://www.github.com/julianfields//sattwa.com"><nobr>Github.com</nobr></a>.
    <br></br>
    Over the last several years, I have used used tools like Bootstrap, NPM, Gulp and Grunt, as well as
    Ruby to develop and ship projects.  With a passion for code and people, a steady curiosity for new
    ways of doing things, and a fearless approach to life, I am always ready to jump into something new.
    Most recently I was a junior designer/developer on a supply chain application built with Clojure.
